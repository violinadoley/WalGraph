# WebWalrus Graph Database Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Complete Step-by-Step Deployment

### Phase 1: Prerequisites Setup

1. **SUI CLI Installation** (Already done)
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/raw/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Wallet Setup for TESTNET**
   ```bash
   # Create new wallet or import existing
   sui client new-address ed25519
   
   # Switch to testnet
   sui client switch --env testnet
   
   # Get testnet SUI tokens
   sui client faucet
   
   # Check balance
   sui client balance
   ```

3. **Walrus CLI Setup**
   ```bash
   # Download Walrus CLI for testnet
   # Visit: https://docs.walrus.space/setup.html
   # Follow testnet setup instructions
   ```

### Phase 2: Smart Contract Deployment

1. **Navigate to Contract Directory**
   ```bash
   cd sui_contracts
   ```

2. **Deploy the Contract**
   ```bash
   # Build the contract
   sui move build
   
   # Deploy to testnet
   sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
   ```

3. **Save Important Addresses**
   After deployment, you'll see output like:
   ```
   Package ID: 0x1a2b3c...
   Registry ID: 0x4d5e6f...
   ```

### Phase 3: Frontend Configuration

1. **Update Environment Variables**
   Create `frontend/.env.local`:
   ```env
   # SUI Contract Configuration (TESTNET)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PACKAGE_ID=0x[your_package_id]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_REGISTRY_ID=0x[your_registry_id]
   
   # Walrus Configuration (TESTNET)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WALRUS_AGGREGATOR_URL=https://aggregator-devnet.walrus.space
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WALRUS_PUBLISHER_URL=https://publisher-devnet.walrus.space
   
   # Network Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUI_NETWORK=testnet
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WALRUS_NETWORK=testnet
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Phase 4: Testing the Complete Flow

1. **Connect Your Wallet**
   - Open http://localhost:3000/editor
   - Click "Connect Wallet"
   - Select your SUI wallet
   - Approve connection

2. **Create Sample Graph Data**
   - Go to "Create" tab
   - Create nodes: Alice (Person), Bob (Person), TechCorp (Company)
   - Create relationships: Alice-KNOWS->Bob, Alice-WORKS_AT->TechCorp

3. **Test Graph Operations**
   - Use "Query" tab to run Cypher-like queries
   - Check "Stats" tab for graph analytics
   - Visualize the graph in the right panel

4. **Save to Blockchain**
   - Go to "Save" tab
   - Fill in graph metadata
   - Click "Save to Walrus & SUI"
   - Approve the transaction in your wallet

### Phase 5: Verify Storage

1. **Check SUI Transaction**
   ```bash
   sui client transaction [transaction_hash]
   ```

2. **Verify Walrus Storage**
   ```bash
   # Use Walrus CLI to verify blob
   walrus blob-read [blob_id]
   ```

### Phase 6: Advanced Features Testing

1. **Graph Analysis**
   - Click "Analyze" to run graph algorithms
   - Check console for centrality measures
   - Test path finding between nodes

2. **Load Existing Graphs**
   - Use the blob ID to load saved graphs
   - Test deserialization and visualization

3. **Query Processing**
   - Test advanced queries in the query editor
   - Verify WHERE clauses and filtering

## ðŸ”§ Architecture Summary

### What You've Built

âœ… **Complete Graph Database Features:**
- **CRUD Operations**: Full Create, Read, Update, Delete for nodes and relationships
- **Query Engine**: Cypher-like query processing with MATCH, WHERE, RETURN clauses
- **Graph Algorithms**: Degree centrality, PageRank, connected components
- **Path Finding**: Shortest path and all paths between nodes
- **Graph Statistics**: Comprehensive analytics and metrics

âœ… **Decentralized Storage:**
- **Walrus Integration**: Large graph data stored as JSON-LD in Walrus blobs
- **SUI Blockchain**: Metadata, ownership, and access control on SUI
- **JSON-LD Serialization**: Proper semantic web standards compliance

âœ… **Frontend Integration:**
