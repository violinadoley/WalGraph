# 🐛 Debug Guide for MATCH Query Issue

## Steps to Test and Debug:

1. **Load Sample Data**:
   - Open the app at http://localhost:3001/editor
   - Click "Create Sample Graph" button in Quick Actions
   - This creates: 3 Person nodes, 1 Company node, 1 Product node

2. **Test MATCH Query**:
   - Go to Query tab
   - Enter: `MATCH (p:Company) RETURN p`
   - Click "Execute Query"
   - Check browser console for debug logs

3. **Debug Logs to Look For**:
   ```
   🚀 STARTING QUERY EXECUTION
   📊 Current graph state: {nodeCount: 5, nodeTypes: ["Person", "Person", "Person", "Company", "Product"]}
   🎯 MATCH command detected: MATCH (p:Company) RETURN p
   🔍 MATCH command: MATCH (p:Company) RETURN p
   🔍 Available nodes: 5
   🔍 Node types: ["Person", "Person", "Person", "Company", "Product"]
   🔍 Parsed: {variable: "p", type: "Company", returnVar: "p"}
   🔍 Filtered by type "Company": 1 nodes
   ✅ MATCH result: {pattern: "(p:Company)", matchedNodes: [...], count: 1}
   🎉 FINAL QUERY RESULT: {...}
   ```

4. **Expected UI Result**:
   - Query Execution Summary should show "1 commands processed, 1 nodes, 0 relationships found"
   - Query Results section should show the Company node with TechCorp data
   - Download buttons should appear

## If Still Not Working:

Check console.log output for where the issue occurs. The extensive debugging should pinpoint exactly where the problem is.
